This service will be responsible for object recognition through Amazon's
rekognition service. It will take in a picture/image, send it to AWS, and
return the resulting categories that were recognized through their service.


TODO: Migrate the recognition service to Firebase; use Google Vision instead of
      Amazon Rekognition.
